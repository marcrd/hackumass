# hackumass
This was a hardware hackathon at UMass hosted by IEEE. We had to use aurdinos. Using a coil and a magnet, we turned mechanical energy into electrical energy. This in theory if refined could be put on a leg or inside a backpack, turning the motion created by running/hiking into energy to charge your phone or other devices. The code here contains the reading of the Aurdino accelerometer to be further refined into a GPS to track distance and routes walked/ran with this device.
